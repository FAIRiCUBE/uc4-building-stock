    "# Estimation of building height using digital elevation data\n",
    "\n",
    "This work strives to test a hypothesis. The hypothesis is that a building height can be estimated by means of the difference between digital terrain model (DTM) and digital surface model (DSM). To test the hypothesis, city of Halle in Germany is considerd in combination with openly available data from Saxony-Anhalt (https://www.lvermgeo.sachsen-anhalt.de/de/kostenfreie_geobasisdaten_lvermgeo.html) and Open Street Map (https://www.openstreetmap.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following procedure is used to test the hypothesis. In the __first__ part, DSM, DTM, and geometry of the buildings are extracted. In the __second__ part, DSM and DTM data are intersected on building geometry and the differenced between the DSM and DTM heights are calculated. And in the __third__ part, a weighted average method is used to estimate flat height with confidence interval of buildings. "
